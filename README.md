# Tilt_Switch_Joystick
This is the GitHub repository for ECE 387's basic chip midterm.
Both sets of code are provided above along with a picture of the circuit diagrams.
Here is the video to the joystick I created https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFm0fToIo6c
and here is the video of the joystick counter https://youtu.be/TAXuFWVHuq4 .
This joystick can be manipulated to fit the needs of other projects.
